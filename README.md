Chuck Norris Jokes React App
============================
This is a tiny app made in react for a 60 minute benchmark test. 60 minutes was spent attempting to achive the following tasks:

###### Task 1
Create a new React project and prepare it for development, including all necessary components and dependencies.

###### Task 2
Create a script that opens irksome alerts displaying Chuck Norris jokes and which can only be stopped or closed by the use of a task manager or "CTRL+ALT+F4".
